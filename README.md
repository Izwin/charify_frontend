# Charify

**Charify** is a charity fundraising application built with Flutter, designed to simplify donations for users. The app features Google authentication via Firebase, seamless payment processing using Stripe, and a clean, user-friendly interface.

> **Note**: Firebase has been removed from this project to enhance security and privacy. The project now does not rely on Firebase for backend services.

This application utilizes the [Charify Backend](https://github.com/Izwin/charify_backend) for its backend services.
